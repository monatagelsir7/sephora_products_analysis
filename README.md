## Sephora Product Analysis for Marketing Executives
### Intended Audience:
The target audience for this memo is the Chief Marketing Officer at Sephora, Zena Srivasta Arnold.
### Audience Background:
**Role**: Senior leader responsible for making strategic decisions on product promotions, inventory
allocation, and campaign performance.
**Time Constraints**: Highly time-constrained, accustomed to concise presentations or executive summaries; likely to scan focused reports and visualizations rather than read detailed analysis.
**Domain Knowledge**: Deep familiarity with Sephora’s product lines and overall beauty retail industry, but not directly involved with day-to-day data analysis. But she has a bachelor in computer science, so she
has some rich statistical knowledge.
**Technical Knowledge**: Comfortable interpreting basic metrics, charts, and trends, and intermediate modeling or statistical jargon.
### Selected Dataset:
We will use the Sephora All Products Dataset, which includes numerical variables (such as price, ratings,
reviews count...) and categorical variables (brand, category, ingredients...) for thousands of products
currently available on Sephora’s website.
### Analytical Questions:
1. Which product categories (i.e: skincare, makeup, hair care) demonstrate the strongest correlation between customer ratings and average price points?
- This question aims to identify whether higher-priced categories also receive higher customer satisfaction, guiding pricing and promotional strategies.
2. What are the top-performing brands by average rating and number of reviews within each category, and how do they compare?
- This will help prioritize brands for future marketing campaigns and promotional placements by mapping customer sentiment and engagement.
### Analytical Approach:
We will conduct descriptive analysis supported by clear visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps)
to illustrate relationships between customer ratings, pricing, and review volume across categories and
brands. The focus will be on easy visuals and actionable insights, avoiding advanced modeling unless a
trend requires further explanation. The goal is to emphasize which products need to stay on the shelves
and which ones need to be discontinued, as well as allocating resources towards the “star” categories.
